       <p>Dear Users,<br> Sadly The Unblocked Hub has shut down. We've faced issues with fundraising and programming errors we are unable to handle. It was great while it lasted, but all good things must come to an end. <br> Our source code is still available on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/TheUnblockedHubOfficial/TheUnblockedHub" style="color:blue;">HERE</a> for anyone who would like to continue The Unblocked Hub. We thank you for supporting us and being through our struggles and hardships and we thank the original users who have been with us since V1. We will miss serving you and breaking you free from the chains that schools and workplaces forced on your devices.
       <br> Thank You for everything  
      <br>The Unblocked Hub
      <br>
      <br>
P.S. You can still access the splash texts below as always until this website permanently closes
          </p>
